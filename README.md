## Project Overview

This repository contains my personal solution to the crime-themed SQL game by Knight Lab [SQL Murder Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/). Follow along as I unravel clues, chase down suspects, and sleuth my way through this quirky query-driven whodunnit.

## Where the Mystery Begins

The SQL game starts with this clue:

> A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.

A database schema diagram is also provided to assist in the investigation:
